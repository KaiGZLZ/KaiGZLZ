### Hi there 👋 I am Jesús González and I am a Full Stack Developer 💻

Here you can see some things that I can do 🔥There are recent projects 🖥️ as well as quite old projects 😅

I have 3 years of experience as a Web Developer but many more as a programmer, so I can say that I have good problem-solving skills 😎

I have only worked on private projects so the repositories cannot be viewed 😅 HOWEVER!!!, to give you an idea, these are the technologies I have worked with:

- ⭐⭐⭐ React
- ⭐⭐⭐ Redux/RTK
- ⭐⭐⭐ NodeJS
- ⭐⭐⭐ Express
- ⭐⭐⭐ MongoDB
- ⭐⭐⭐ TypeScript
- ⭐⭐ NextJS
- ⭐⭐ Bootstrap
- ⭐⭐ MySQL
- ⭐⭐ ChakraUI
- ⭐⭐ React Testing Library
<br/>
- ⭐ I wont show technologies that I don´t handle decently 😉
<br/>
<br/>
I also have permission to show some projects I have worked on (although not the code 😅) so if you contact me, I can quickly show what I can do 💪
<br/>
<br/>
Happy coding!!!
